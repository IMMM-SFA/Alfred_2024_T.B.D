Contains historical heat wave-related variables (number of heat wave events each year, total heat wave days each year, and highest temperature of the hottest event each year) at the state-level, which is aggregated from the county-level data weighted by county population. Each file corresponds to one definition of heat wave (total of 12 definitions). Within the data, "GEOID" is the unique identifier for each county, and 3 heat wave-related variables are abbreviated as "No" (Number of heat wave events each year), "Day" (Total heat wave days each year), and "Tem" (Highest temperature of the hottest event each year). Following each variable abbreviation is the metrics used for the county-level aggregation, including mean (taking the mean), min (taking the minima), and max (taking the maxima). In the end, the four numerical value indicates the year. For example, "No_max_1982" is the state-level number of heat wave events aggregated based on the county-level variable aggregated using maxima.
