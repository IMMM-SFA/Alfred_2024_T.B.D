These are the heat wave variables (Number of heat wave events each year, total heat wave days each year, and highest temperature of the hottest event each year) aggregated at the Balancing Authority (BA) level. The BA level variables are aggregated from counties based on population-weighted aggregation. There are 12 files, with each file corresponds to one definition of heat wave (total of 12 definitions). Within the data, "BA_code" is the unique identifier for each BA, and 3 heat wave-related variables are abbreviated as "No" (Number of heat wave events each year), "Day" (Total heat wave days each year), and "Tem" (Highest temperature of the hottest event each year). Following each variable abbreviation is the metrics used for the county-level aggregation, including mean (taking the mean), min (taking the minima), and max (taking the maxima). In the end, the four numerical value indicates the year. For example, "No_max_1982" is the BA-level number of heat wave events in 1982 based on the county-level variable aggregated using maxima.
