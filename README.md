## Introduction
Aggregate three historical (1980-2019) heat wave-related variables (number of heat wave events each year, total heat wave days each year, and highest temperature of the hottest event each year) from 1/8 degree (~12.5 km) grids to county level and Balancing Authority(BA)-level. Heat wave-related variables are calculated based on outputs from Weather Research & Forecasting Model (WRF) and are defined by 12 different heat wave definitions. The aggregation to the county-level involves aggregating by taking the mean, minima, and maxima, while the aggregation to the BA-level implements population-based weighting.
